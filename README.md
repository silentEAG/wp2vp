# wp2vp
A simple python script working for transforming Wordpress posts to Vuepress markdown format, with meta data attached to them.

## Previous work
you need to download the Wordpress's SQL data and put it into a database. After make config all done, run this script and you'll get the markdown files. By the way, my test environment consisted of vuepress v2-beta39, theme is Gungnir v2, is going well. Hope your environment goes well too. :)

## And then?
For the moment, you have to read the source code by yourselves because it's still under coding (if I have some spare time). Also its features are so little that may be it's unnecessary to guide you how to work :<
